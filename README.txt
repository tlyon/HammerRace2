Our app is a game that involves hammering a virtual nail into a board and allows 
for the user to connect two devices together and compete against one another for the
fastest time.  

The app creates a virtual hammer that appears to move on a virtual background as you
rotate the device through the air.  Based on the change in acceleration, the nail will
move into the board.
